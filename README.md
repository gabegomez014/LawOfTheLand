# LawOfTheLand
Game Off 2022 Game Jam

# Purpose
This was a game I created for the Game Off 2022 Game Jam. 

# What is the game?
This game is a action/beat-em up where you try to defeat five rounds of enemy snakes

# What did I work on in the game?
In this game, I primarily focused on the level design and programming aspect of things and touched on , and utilized assets to help with animations, models, VFX, and UI. While I did use assets for a few different aspects, for each asset I used I ended up modifying and extending them to fit the goals I was trying to achieve for my game. This was a great learning experience, and only made me more excited to create more

# Will I make updates to the game?
Most likely not. This was a fun project for a month. I learned a lot in its development I plan to take forward as I continue to work on games. 

# Can the game be built out of the box?
If you download this source code, I doubt it will work out of the box. I kept assets I used out of the source code on purpose to not have the creators works out there, which is a rule to be followed according to the terms and agreements of asset store purchases. If there is interest, I can let people know which assets I used.
